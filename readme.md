# Struct JS

StructJS aims to create a C-like struct type to make working with binary files easier. It also tries to be as simple as possible and make good use existing file access features of JavaScript like [DataView](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView).

## Installation
